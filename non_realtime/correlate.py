# correlate.py Demo of retrieving signal buried in noise

# Released under the MIT licence.
# Copyright Peter Hinch 2018

# This simulates a Pyboard ADC acquiring a signal using read_timed. The signal is
# digital (switching between two fixed voltages) but is corrupted by a larger analog
# noise source.
# The output array contains the correlation of the corrupted input with the known
# expected signal.
# A successful detection comprises a uniquely large value at sample 930 where the
# signal happens to be located. The program also outputs the second largest
# correlation value and the ratio of the two as a measure of the certainty of
# detection.

# The chosen signal is a pseudo-random digital burst. This was chosen because the
# auto-correlation function of random noise is an impulse function.

# In this test it is added to a pseudo-random analog signal of much longer
# duration to test the reliability of discriminaton.
