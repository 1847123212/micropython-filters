# This program simulates the acquisition of an array of samples on a Pyboard ADC
# using read_timed. The received signal is a sinewave biassed to lie in the
# middle of the ADC voltage range. Two FIR filters are applied.
# The first is a low pass filter which extracts the DC bias level.
# The second is a bandpass filter which extracts the signal. The passband is
# centred on a frequency corresponding to 8 cycles in the input buffer. The
# rejection characteristics may be demonstrated by altering the value of
# NCYCLES - try a value of 6 or 12.
# See coeffs.py for bandpass filter characteristics.
